## Using ReasonML in your next React project
*by Roy Derks (https://twitter.com/gethackteam)*

ReasonML is based on the OCaml programming language and was created at Facebook, by the same creator as React! It shares a lot of features, but with the benefits of a statically typed functional programming language. ReasonML compiles to JavaScript and can therefore be used to create strongly typed React applications.

## Installation
```sh
npm install
```

## Usage

```sh
npm start
```

The BuckleScript compiler only does it magic on the first run, to continue watching for updates in your Reason files, open another terminal / command prompt where you execute:

```sh
bsb bsb -make-world -w
```
